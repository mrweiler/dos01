# <small>Who am I?</small>

----

My name is Matthias Weiler

----

I am a psychologist

----

I am a psychotherapist

----

I work as a research assistant <br>at Freie Universität Berlin

----

I am a nerd

----

I like free software

----

I like open science



# <small>And who are you?</small>

----

Please raise your hand ...

----

... if you study psychology

----

... if you want to become a psychotherapist

----

... if you want to become a scientist

----

... if you have participated in <br>a (small) research project

----

... if you know what open science is

----

... if you are (a little) anxious <br>to speak English in class



# <small>What are we going to do here?</small>

----

In the course of this semester you will...

----

... learn what open science is

----

... get to know tools that help <br>you with your research

----

... learn how (not) to cheat with science

----

... plan and conduct a small research project

----

... present your results to others



# <small>Any questions so far?</small>



# <small>Today:<br>Introduction to digital open science</small>



# <small>Science - how does it work?</small>

----

Please take 2 minutes to think <br>
about how you would conduct a <br>
(small) research project from scratch

----

Now take 5 minutes to discuss <br>
your thoughts with two people <br> 
sitting next to you

----

What would be your steps?

----

My suggestions:

----

"Generate and specify hypothesis"

----

"Design study"

----

"Conduct study and collect data"

----

"Analyse data and test hypothesis"

----

"Interpret results"

----

"Publish and/or conduct next experiment"

# <small>How would you make this <br>process (more) open?</small>

----

Please take 2 minutes to think about it

----

Now take 5 minutes to discuss <br>
your thoughts with your neighbors

What would you do?



# <small>Seven easy steps for open science</small>

----

by Mitja Back, Friederike Hendriks, <br>Felix Schönbrodt and the NOSI

----

1. Create an account at the <br>Open Science Framework

----

2. Preregister your studies

----

3. Open materials

----

4. Open data

----

5. Reproducible Code

----

6. Open Access

----

7. Do open research and talk about it



# <small>Do you see any problems <br>regarding open science?</small>

----

Please take 2 minutes to think about it

----

Now take 5 minutes to discuss <br>
your thoughts with your neighbors

----

What others are saying ...

----

"Someone could steal my idea"

----

"I am afraid someone could spot a mistake"

----

"I spent time and money collecting data <br>
and I don't want others to use it"

----

"I don't want to risk the <br>anonymity of my subjects" 

----

"I want to use the data <br>for another study as well"

----

We will (hopefully) know more about <br>dealing with these problems <br>at the end of the semester
